This is an example using UrlRewriter for ASP.NET.

It is available here with documentation: http://urlrewriter.net/

To view the the rewriter in action, try these two URLS (where "~" is your site's root):

~/Default.aspx
~/open/Default.aspx

In either case, you should be forced to login (simply enter a name). 

Between links, post backs, and redirects, you should maintain the same base directory.
